# Project Title

Erply E-Commerce APP


## USER GUIDE ##
## Getting Started ()

To enable usage of the e-shop webapp it is necessary to have a good internet connection. Using a web browser (Google chrome, internet explore, Mozilla Firefox etc) you can open the index.html file to access the project.


## DEVELOPER GUIDE ##
## Getting Started ()

I implemented Gulp for the development.
If you prefer to use Gulp to run the webapp to enable usage of the e-shop webapp it is necessary to have node.js in your computer. Open the command prompt and run the commands "npm install gulp", "npm install", and "gulp" in the root directory.
